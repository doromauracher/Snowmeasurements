### Deadlines:
* 13.01.2022 git hub repository
* 25.01.2023 raw data temperature
* 10.02.2023 
  * raw data force -> raw data finished
  * mechanical design
  * data visualiuation in excel
* 17.02.2023 sensoric part
* TESTING!

## Tasks
The designed probe should detect different types of snow by being stuck in it. The aim is to measure data over the height of the snow and form a snow profile.

## Definitions (09.01.2023)
Force Measurement
* Induction

Orientation: 
* IMU for orientation and depth measurement
* Temperature sensors: all have the same temperature in the air, when stuck into snow the temperature changes -> calculate the depth +/- 5 cm
* Optional: US for depth measurement 
Combine at least 2 measurements for depth calculation
