Extract the zip file and copy the "ArduSpreadsheet" folder into your Arduino "tools" folder next to the Arduino "libraries" folder. <br>
If the "tools" folder doesn't exist, then you can create it yourself. <br>
C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Arduino\tools <br>
<br>
Restart your Arduino IDE, and you should see "ArduSpreadsheet" under the "Tools" menu. <br>
